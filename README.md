Openki Extension for Bolt CMS
=====================

"Openki is an interactive web-platform under development with the ambition to facilitate a barrier-free access to education for everyone." ( [Openki](https://openki.net) )

This repo gives an example for an extension to include data via [Openki API](https://github.com/Openki/Openki/wiki/JSON-API)  in [Bolt CMS](http://bolt.cm) . Completely alpha but already in use [here](https://www.bildung-fuer-alle.ch/seite/stundenplan).
